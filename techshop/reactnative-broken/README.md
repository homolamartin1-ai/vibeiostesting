# TechShop iOS — React Native (Broken)

The **broken** React Native build of TechShop, with 15 core bugs + 2 mobile-specific
bugs planted for the test suites to catch. The same bugs are planted in the SwiftUI build.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npx expo start --ios      # boots the iOS Simulator and installs the app
```

**Credentials:** demo@techshop.com / password123

> Note: **BUG-011** makes "Proceed to Checkout" a no-op, so the Checkout screen is
> unreachable in the broken build via the button — that is the blocker bug. The checkout
> bugs (009, 010, 012, 013, 017) are verified against the **fixed** build. This mirrors a
> real blocker that gates downstream tests.
